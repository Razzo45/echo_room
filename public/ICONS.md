# PWA Icons

For production, add the following icon files to this directory:
- icon-192.png (192x192px)
- icon-512.png (512x512px)

These should be simple, recognizable icons for the Micro MMO app.

For development, the app will work without these icons, but for a proper PWA experience they should be added before deployment.

You can generate icons using tools like:
